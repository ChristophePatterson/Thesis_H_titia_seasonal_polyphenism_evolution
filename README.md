Code for the recreation of Chapter 5 of my Thesis "Multivariate trait evolution of a seasonal polyphenism at the continental scale".

### Main results
For running SNAPP see [SNAPP_run_array_hydro_basins_Chap_4.sh](https://github.com/ChristophePatterson/Thesis_H_titia_seasonal_polyphenism_evolution/blob/main/scripts/SNAPP/SNAPP_run_array_hydro_basins_Chap_4.sh)
For running multivariet models of trait evolution see [Model_estimates_mvMORPH.R](https://github.com/ChristophePatterson/Thesis_H_titia_seasonal_polyphenism_evolution/blob/main/scripts/Model_estimates_mvMORPH.R)

#### Running code
Note sections of code have been hashed out to reduced run time. 

#### Extra material
SNP calling for producing vcf for input into SNAPP is in the repository for [Chapter 4](https://github.com/ChristophePatterson/Thesis-Phylogeographic-Hetaerina).
